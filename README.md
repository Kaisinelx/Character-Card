# Character Card

This project displays a fantasy themed character card that can flip to reveal more details.

## Running Locally
Simply open `index.html` in a modern web browser. Character data is loaded from `character.json`, so keep these files in the same directory.

## Deployment
Because everything is static, you can host the folder on any static site service such as GitHub Pages or Netlify. For GitHub Pages, push the repository and enable Pages in the repository settings. For Netlify, drag and drop the folder or connect your repo.

## Customizing
Edit `character.json` to change the character name, stats and text. The page will update automatically when reloaded.
